Just a repository for my Drawbot's scripts.

# guidelines_calligraphy.py
This is a guideline’s maker for calligraphy training. This script basically takes your broad nib width and the alphabet's proportion and draws the guides for you.

How to use this:

After open and running the script in DrawBot:

1) in nib_size, insert your nib width  (in milimeters);
2) in nib angle, put the pen angle (in degrees);
3) in xHeight, the x-Height of your alphabet (in nib widths);
4) the ascender in nib widths;
5) the descender.

Thanks to everyone who contributed with ideas, suggestions, comments, etc. Special thanks to my little brother Lucas Negrão, who's a much better programmer than I am.
